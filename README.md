The folder 'notebooks' contains the experiments with Neuralforecast and Darts models. The Neuralforecast notebooks were run on Google Colab with a 40GB RAM GPU A100. Using a GPU with less RAM on these notebooks may result in cuda out of memory. The Darts notebooks were run on Kaggle with GPU P100. Submissions to the competition are only allowed via offline Kaggle notebooks. The Darts and Neuralforecast packages have to imported via a utility script.

The project raport contains the background, related work, methods, results and discussion of the project.
